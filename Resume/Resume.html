	<h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
	<p class="company">Pease Park Conservancy</p> 
		<p class="job"><span class ="jobTitle">Creative and Technology Services Manager</span> 	<span class="jobTitleDates">Jan 2019 - Dec 2021</span></p>
	<ul>
		<div class="expandable-text">
		<li>Fostered the organization from a two-person team with a $200,000 annual budget to a twelve-person team with a $1.4 million annual budget<span class="extra-text">. When I joined, there were only two employees in the backroom of a law office, and the organization had not yet launched their capital campaign to raise $15 million for the Kingsbury Commons Project, their first major construction project from the Pease Park Vision Plan. Over the course of four years, I helped the Conservancy grow, professionalize, and expand to a healthy and stable place with a plan for a sustainable future. I am proud of the work that I accomplished and I am even more proud of where the organization is now.
</span></li>
		</div>
		<div class="expandable-text">
<li>Improved the development teams ability to maintain, manipulate, and report data by integrating all donor information, including over 8,000 contacts and accounts into Salesforce CRM increasing team efficiency and donor retention<span class="extra-text">. When I joined the organization all of the donor information was being kept in physical files and printed out spreadsheets. I single-handedly transistioned all of our current data into a Salesforce CRM, built custom weekly and quarterly reports, and automated/integrated all online donation and volunteer forms with our CRM.</span></li>
		</div>
		<div class="expandable-text">
		<li>As sole Salesforce Administrator, responsible for training existing staff on best practices, addressing/debugging issues, maintaining data integrity and building out new functionality and workflows within the CRM<span class="extra-text">. One of the greatest difficulties in CRMs is customer/donor data integrity and maintaining that integrity as more and more users are added. I worked with each system user to ensure that best practices were being followed and more importantly that the system worked within their personal workflows. Being a small staff with no dedicated employees to the CRM, we needed a system that would work by itself, and so I spent a great time integrating software into Salesforce that would automate data entry for us and built automated reports and report templates so staff could work efficiently with little input to the CRM.</span></li></div>
		<div class="expandable-text">
		<li>Skillfully designed digital content and printed materials (illustrations, gifs, videos, emails, signage, event materials, letterhead, booklets, swag, business cards) using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign and Premiere<span class="extra-text">. When I started at the Conservancy I had never used Adobe, but I quickly picked it up after a few YouTube tutorials. I may not have any formal education in design, but I do have a natural tact for it - at least that's what my boss thought. I designed multiple campaigns consisting of both print and digital materials, marketed events, ran hundreds of email campaigns and I was slated to move into a Creative Director position before I decided to leave the Conservancy.</span></li></div>
		<div class="expandable-text">
		<li>Built a new company website integrating new company branding, donation software, Salesforce CRM, and email marketing software to offload and reduce team workload increasing monthly visitor traffic from 500 to 5000<span class="extra-text">. After College, I did freelance work building websites, and that is how I was first introduced to Pease Park Conservancy. I was maintaining their outdated website, which was "hard-coded". After being hired, I moved the company to Squarespace, so that they wouldn't need to hire someone like me to update their website.</span></li></div>
		<div class="expandable-text"><li>Streamlined new processes for revenue and expense reporting, the annual audit, budget reconciliation, physical and digital filing, payroll and benefit selection, invoicing, meeting scheduling, and donor moves management<span class="extra-text">. Before my title changed to <i>Creative and Technology Services Manager</i>, I was <i>Operations Manager</i>. I was given that title because I guess I was organized, but mostly because I wanted everything to be simple and effecient, so I put emphasis on streamlining everything. I moved our revenue and expense reporting to a Airtable, digitized our entire library of documents, fired our insurance brokers and moved our benefits to Gusto, set up everyone on different shared Google Calendars, organized all of our board and committee meetings and kept track of all of our donors and our donation solicitations.</span></li></div>
			</ul>
<p class="job"><span class ="jobTitle">Development and Communications Coordinator</span> 	<span class="jobTitleDates">Oct 2017 - Jan 2019</span></p>
	<ul>
	<div class="expandable-text"><li>Oversaw all external communications and expanded followers across all social platforms by 300% in under a year<span class="extra-text">. I accomplished this by changing all of our handles to simply @peasepark, changing our location to the park so that people would tag us when they were in the park, and then sharing the content that those users produced onto our own page. I did run ad campaigns, but I found a lot more success by just directly engaging with the users of the park.</span></li></div>
	<div class="expandable-text"><li>Developed, organized, and oversaw new park fundraising, volunteer, and park activation events; coordinated public and private stakeholder input meetings, board meetings, and committee meetings; and led biweekly volunteer projects in the park<span class="extra-text">. By far my favorite part of my role with the Conservancy was event planning and there were a lot of events given that a large part of our mission was to activate the park so that everyone in Austin feels welcome. That activation included volunteer efforts, public art, parties/galas in the park, public input meetings, and Eeyore's. I organized the events, solicited volunteers, designed the look and feel, marketed them, and then led the events. I enjoyed it, a lot.</span></li></div>
	<div class="expandable-text"><li>Surpassed $100,000 budget in grant funding and initiated $25,000 in new annual fundraising campaigns<span class="extra-text">. I write good. I am being ironic, but I do actually have a good grasp of grammar and the written language. So when I first started I used that skill to write grants for the organization. I was also in charge of minor fundraising campaigns like #GivingTuesday and Amplify Austin, and our physical mailers(send us a check stuff).</span></li></div>
	</ul>
	<p class="company">Self-Employed</p>
<p class="job"><span class ="jobTitle">Web Developer</span> 	<span class="jobTitleDates">Jan 2017 - Oct 2017</span></p>
	<ul>
<div class="expandable-text"><li>Built and maintained dynamic websites and CRMs for local business and nonprofits<span class="extra-text">. I worked with two organizations, Austin Smiles, a non-profit that focused on children with cleft lip and palate in Central and South America, and Pease Park Conservancy. At Austin Smiles I worked on fixing and maintaining their SalsaCRM and their website built on PHP in WordPress. At Pease Park Conservancy, I worked on fixing their custom built website and Wufoo forms.</span></li></div>
	</ul>
		<p class="company">Empact IT Solutions</p>
<p class="job"><span class ="jobTitle">Analytics Intern</span> 	<span class="jobTitleDates">Jun 2013 - Aug 2013</span></p>
	<ul>
	<div class="expandable-text"><li>Worked with analytics team to create, maintain and test Microsoft SQL Server Databases and build BI packages<span class="extra-text">. I spent a lot of time debugging and cleaning up data within their databases. The team I was working with was building out a Database for an insurance company and I was alpha testing the database. I built Business Intelligence packages for their in-house database based on a template I was given.</span></li></div>
	<div class="expandable-text"><li>Updated multiple databases using combination of SQL Queries and Excel functions running nearly 1000 insert/update queries daily<span class="extra-text">. I took large excel spreadsheets of data and added rows of SQL queries and then I ran them in Microsoft SQL Server and I did that daily.</span></li></div>
		<div class="expandable-text"><li>Engineered and launched new database for cattle tracking as part of final project<span class="extra-text">. The project kept information about cattle, their location, their medication, and their offspring. I built a custom database and then a custom website to run queries of the database.</span></li></div>
	</ul>
	<p class="company">Vatani Consulting Engineers</p>
<p class="job"><span class ="jobTitle">Plan Coordinator</span> 	<span class="jobTitleDates">Jun 2012 - Aug 2012</span></p>
	<ul>
<div class="expandable-text"><li>Coordinated with city permitting agencies to approve civil and architectural site plans<span class="extra-text">. My main role was to run civil and architectural plans to the different city bureaucracies and sit with the city planners to get them approved, but in addition to that role I completely rebuilt the company website, digitized all of the documents in the office, and set up the employees with a new software to track their billable hours which they were doing by hand. This was my first job out of high school.</span></li></div>
